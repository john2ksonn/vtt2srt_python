# vtt2srt_python
A simple implementation of an vtt to srt converter. These filetypes are used for subtitles. I needed a simple converter for an app I (until now only partially) wrote to edit youtube's subtitles.

If you encounter an issue using this please open an issue report.
If you want to commit any improvents you are free to make a pull request.

There is also an [implementation in java](https://github.com/john2ksonn/vtt2srt_java)

**Edit 30.01.2020:** I rewrote it to use regex to find the timing line. This resulted in a shorter and hopefully easier to understand implementation.
